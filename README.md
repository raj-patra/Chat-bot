# Nicole - The Chat bot

Nicole is an intelligent chatbot made out of AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) files.

There are two codes in the Repository-

	"chat_bot_cmd.py" runs in the Python console, taking prompts from the user and providing with witty replies based on its brain.

	"chat_room.py" is a GUI made with Tkinter for python, an easy to use interface which gives a chat room experience.
	
The ".brn" file , also known as the brain file of the chatbot is also included. Feel free to delete the brain file and retrain it by adding even more aiml files in the respective folder. 


Pre-requisite packages-
	aiml
	tkinter
